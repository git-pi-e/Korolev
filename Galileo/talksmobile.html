        <h1>COSMIC DAWN ~ 14/1/20</h1>
        <h1 style="font-size:1rem;">RAVI SUBRAHMANYAN</h1>
        <p>As first light from the first stars transforms the universe from the dark ages into cosmic dawn, the history
          may be traced in redshifted 21-cm from neutral hydrogen in the gas. Efforts to build precision radio
          telescopes to detect this faint signal are beginning to yield results of significance to the theory, thus
          constraining the starlight of the earliest galaxies.</p>

        <h1>UNDERSTANDING THE UNIVERSE ~ 13/1/20</h1>
        <h1 style="font-size:1rem;">RAVI SUBRAHMANYAN</h1>
        <p>Telescopes give panoramic visions of galaxies and stars in our present day nearby universe. We live in an
          expanding universe; therefore, light from early times in the history of the universe arrives on Earth shifted
          to the red as far as radio waves, and radio telescopes on ground and in space have given us a vision of the
          time when the first atoms formed and the universe was a very uniform hot gas. Understanding the transformation
          from that primordial gas to stars and galaxies is an unsolved problem.</p>

        <h1>THE SOUTH AFRICAN LARGE TELESCOPE ~ 20/11/19</h1>
        <h1 style="font-size:1rem;">PHIL CHARLES</h1>
        <p>The Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) is the largest single optical telescope in the southern
          hemisphere and among the largest in the world. It has a hexagonal primary mirror array 11 metres across,
          comprising 91 individual 1m hexagonal mirrors. SALT is situated at the South African Astronomical Observatory
          (SAAO) field station near the small town of Sutherland, in the Northern Cape province, about 400 km from Cape
          Town.</p>

        <h1>SCHRODINGER'S CAT AND EINSTEIN'S SPACE TIME ~ 10/11/19</h1>
        <h1 style="font-size:1rem;">TEJINDER PAL SINGH</h1>
        <p>Quantum mechanics works beautifully in the realm of elementary particles, atoms and molecules. But it seems
          to fail for large objects, even though large objects are made of particles which by themselves obey quantum
          mechanics. What is the reason for this failure?
          Einstein's theory of relativity works beautifully for space-time and large objects, but seems to fail in the
          realm of particles and atoms. What is the reason for this failure?

        <h1>BARYON ACOUSTIC OSCILLATIONS ~ 9/11/19</h1>
        <h1 style="font-size:1rem;">RAVI K SHETH</h1>
        <p>In cosmology, baryon acoustic oscillations are fluctuations in the density of the visible baryonic matter
          (normal matter) of the universe, caused by acoustic density waves in the primordial plasma of the early
          universe. In the same way that supernovae provide a "standard candle" for astronomical observations, BAO
          matter clustering provides a "standard ruler" for length scale in cosmology.</p>

        <h1>FAULT IN OUR PHYSICS ~ 9/11/19</h1>
        <h1 style="font-size:1rem;">AYUSH AGRAWAL</h1>
        <p>The combination of escapism and delving into wonderful worlds with infinite possibilities, brought to us by
          science fiction sure does entertain our minds. Along with inspiring ideas and methods, it allows us to look at
          the bigger picture. This particular lecture takes it a step forward by analysing the way in which various
          sci-fi movies managed to break the boundaries of physics and for what purpose. In what other ways could a
          particular stunt be done and what else could be achieved in a universe with such laws.</p>

        <h1>NUMERICAL RELATIVITY ~ 22/10/19</h1>
        <h1 style="font-size:1rem;">DAVID RADICE</h1>
        <p>Numerical relativity allows us to recreate cataclysmic cosmic phenomena that are otherwise inaccessible in
          the conventional laboratory – like gravitational collapse to black holes and neutron stars and the generation
          and propagation of gravitational waves. With supercomputers, it is now possible to tackle these equations
          numerically and explore these scenarios. That is the main goal of numerical relativity, the science of
          developing computer algorithms to solve Einstein’s equations for astrophysically realistic, high-velocity,
          strong-ﬁeld systems.</p>

        <h1>ICE CUBE ~ 18/10/19</h1>
        <h1 style="font-size:1rem;">FRANCIS HALZEN</h1>
        <p>The IceCube project at the South Pole melted eighty-six holes over 2.5 kilometers deep in the Antarctic
          icecap to construct an enormous astronomical observatory. The experiment recently discovered a flux of
          neutrinos reaching us from the cosmos, with energies a million times those of neutrinos produced at
          accelerator laboratories. The observation launches an entirely new way to study the universe because these
          cosmic neutrinos are astronomical messengers reaching us from some of the most violent processes in the early
          universe since the Big Bang.</p>
