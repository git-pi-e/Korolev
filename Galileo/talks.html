        <p>As first light from the first stars transforms the universe from the dark ages into cosmic dawn, the history
          may be traced in redshifted 21-cm from neutral hydrogen in the gas. Efforts to build precision radio
          telescopes to detect this faint signal are beginning to yield results of significance to the theory, thus
          constraining the starlight of the earliest galaxies.</p>

        <p>Telescopes give panoramic visions of galaxies and stars in our present day nearby universe. We live in an
          expanding universe; therefore, light from early times in the history of the universe arrives on Earth shifted
          to the red as far as radio waves, and radio telescopes on ground and in space have given us a vision of the
          time when the first atoms formed and the universe was a very uniform hot gas. Understanding the transformation
          from that primordial gas to stars and galaxies is an unsolved problem.</p>

        <p>The Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) is the largest single optical telescope in the southern
          hemisphere and among the largest in the world. It has a hexagonal primary mirror array 11 metres across,
          comprising 91 individual 1m hexagonal mirrors. SALT is situated at the South African Astronomical Observatory
          (SAAO) field station near the small town of Sutherland, in the Northern Cape province, about 400 km from Cape
          Town.</p>

        <p style="font-size: .75rem;">The lecture began with a look at humanity’s approaches at map making through the
          ages, beginning with the assumption of a flat circular earth atop a cylinder to the globe-like shape we know
          today. The lecture went on to cover the correlation between Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation, its
          fluctuations and the expansion of the universe. He then discussed the dragging effect of photons on baryons
          (particles composing of three quarks, such as protons and neutrons). He explained the angular fluctuations
          observed due to this phenomenon can be used to understand and map the geometry of the universe. He finally
          explained the phenomenon of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), which is, according to him, cosmology from the
          same physics imprinted in the galaxy distribution at different distances from us.</p>

        <p>The combination of escapism and delving into wonderful worlds with infinite possibilities, brought to us by
          science fiction sure does entertain our minds. Along with inspiring ideas and methods, it allows us to look at
          the bigger picture. This particular lecture takes it a step forward by analysing the way in which various
          sci-fi movies managed to break the boundaries of physics and for what purpose. In what other ways could a
          particular stunt be done and what else could be achieved in a universe with such laws.</p>

        <p>Numerical relativity allows us to recreate cataclysmic cosmic phenomena that are otherwise inaccessible in
          the conventional laboratory – like gravitational collapse to black holes and neutron stars and the generation
          and propagation of gravitational waves. With supercomputers, it is now possible to tackle these equations
          numerically and explore these scenarios. That is the main goal of numerical relativity, the science of
          developing computer algorithms to solve Einstein’s equations for astrophysically realistic, high-velocity,
          strong-ﬁeld systems.</p>

        <p>The IceCube project at the South Pole melted eighty-six holes over 2.5 kilometers deep in the Antarctic
          icecap to construct an enormous astronomical observatory. The experiment recently discovered a flux of
          neutrinos reaching us from the cosmos, with energies a million times those of neutrinos produced at
          accelerator laboratories. The observation launches an entirely new way to study the universe because these
          cosmic neutrinos are astronomical messengers reaching us from some of the most violent processes in the early
          universe since the Big Bang.</p>
